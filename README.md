# Tyk Sync

![Unstable packages](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-sync/workflows/Unstable%20packages/badge.svg)

## What is it?

Tyk Sync is a command line tool and library to manage and synchronise a Tyk installation with your version control system (VCS).

*Note: the project was originally called `tyk-git` however this was changed to `tyk-sync` as it evolved and can now synchronise to files not just git repos.*

## Features

- Update APIs and policies on remote Tyk Dashboards
- Update APIs on remote Tyk CE Gateways
- Publish APIS/Policies to remote Tyk Dashboards
- Publish APIs to remote Tyk CE Gateways
- Synchronise a Tyk Dashboard's APIs and Policies with your VCS (one-way, definitions are written to the Dashboard)
- Synchronise a Tyk CE Gateway's APIs with those stored in a VCS (one-way, definitions are written to the Gateway)
- Dump Policies and APIs in a transportable format from a Dashboard to a directory
- Support for importing, converting and publishing Swagger (Open API Spec) files to Tyk.
- Specialized support for Git. But since API and policy definitions can be read directly from
the file system, it will integrate with any VCS.

### Sync

Tyk Sync tries to be clever about what APIs and Policies to update and which to create, it will actually base all
ID matching on the API ID and the masked Policy ID, so it can identify the same object across installations. Tyk has
a tendency to generate fresh IDs for all new Objects, so Tyk Sync gets around this by using portable IDs and ensuring
the necessary portable IDs are set when using the `dump` command.

This means that Tyk Sync can be used to back-up your most important API Gateway configurations as code, and to deploy
those configurations to any target and ensure that API IDs and Policy IDs will remain consistent, ensuring that any
dependent tokens continue to have access to your services.

### Prerequisites:

- Tyk Sync was built using Go 1.16. The minimum Go version required to install is 1.16.
- In order for policy ID matching to work correctly, your Dashboard must have `allow_explicit_policy_id: true` and `enable_duplicate_slugs: true`.
- In order for policy ID matching to work correctly, your Gateway must have `policies.allow_explicit_policy_id: true`.
- It is assumed you have a Tyk CE or Tyk Pro installation.

## Installation

Currently the application is available via Go, Docker and in packagecloud, so to install via Go you must have Go installed and run:

 ```
 go get -u github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-sync
 ```
This should make the `tyk-sync` command available to your console.

### Docker:

To install a particular version of Tyk Sync via docker image please run the following command stating the version you want to use. A list of all available versions can be found on the Tyk Sync Docker Hub page: https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/tyk-sync/tags
```
docker pull tykio/tyk-sync:{version_id}
```
To run `tyk-sync` as a one-off command and display usage options please do:
```
docker run -it --rm tykio/tyk-sync:{version_id} help
```
Then the docker image `tyk-sync` can be used in the following way:
```
docker run -it --rm tykio/tyk-sync:{version_id} [flags]
docker run -it --rm tykio/tyk-sync:{version_id} [command]
```
## Usage

```
Usage:
  tyk-sync [flags]
  tyk-sync [command]

Available Commands:
  dump        Dump will extract policies and APIs from a target (dashboard)
  help        Help about any command
  publish     publish API definitions from a Git repo or file system to a gateway or dashboard
  sync        Synchronise a github repo or file system with a gateway
  update      A brief description of your command
  version     This command will show the current Tyk-Sync version

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for tyk-sync

Use "tyk-sync [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Example: Transfer from one Tyk Dashboard to another

First, we need to extract the data from our Tyk Dashboard, here we `dump` into ./tmp, let's assume this is a git-enabled
directory

```
tyk-sync dump -d="http://localhost:3000" -s="b2d420ca5302442b6f20100f76de7d83" -t="./tmp"
Extracting APIs and Policies from http://localhost:3000
> Fetching policies
--> Identified 1 policies
--> Fetching and cleaning policy objects
> Fetching APIs
--> Fetched 3 APIs
> Creating spec file in: tmp/.tyk.json
Done.
```

Next, let's push those changes back to the Git repo on the branch `my-test-branch`:

```
cd tmp
git add .
git commit -m "My dashboard dump"
git push -u origin my-test-branch
```

Now to restore this data directly from GitHub:

```
tyk-sync sync -d="http://localhost:3010" -s="b2d420ca5302442b6f20100f76de7d83" -b="refs/heads/my-test-branch" https://github.com/myname/my-test.git

Processing Policies...

SYNC Updating Policy: Test policy 1
--> Found policy using explicit ID, substituting remote ID for update
```

The command provides output to identify which actions have been taken. If using a Tyk Gateway, the Gateway will be
automatically hot-reloaded.


## Example: Check the currently installed version of Tyk Sync

To check the current Tyk Sync version, we need to run the version command:

```
tyk-sync version
v1.2.2
```
